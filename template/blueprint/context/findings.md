# Findings

> **Generated file.** The findings index, loaded every session: one heading per
> live finding - `### F-03 [P0] open - <title>` and a `File:` line under it -
> and nothing else. The full entry is `blueprint/findings/F-03.md`, read when
> acting on that finding; **status lives only here**, evidence in the entry's
> **Resolution**. `review` raises code findings; `build` marks a repair `fixed`;
> only a later `review` pass moves it to `closed` - except a P2 or P3 whose
> repair `build` saw a test fail without, which `build` closes itself. **A
> finding no code fixes** - raised by `preflight` or `host`, such as missing
> backups or a leaked secret - is marked `fixed` with evidence by whichever
> skill repairs it, and `preflight` re-checks and closes it. `ship` refuses to
> merge while any P0 or P1 finding is `open` or `fixed`, then archives resolved
> findings with the work item, moves unresolved P3s to
> `blueprint/findings/backlog.md`, and resets this file. A finding the user puts
> off rather than abandons is `deferred`, with a
> `Deferred to:` line naming the skill that will do it: it gates nothing, stays
> in the ledger through `ship`, and `preflight` reports it at every audit until
> that skill has run.
